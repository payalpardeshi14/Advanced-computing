1. write a program that prints "hellow world"to the screen.
step1= Start
step2=type the "hellow world".
step3=End

2.write a program that ask the user for their name and greets them with their name.
step1=Start
step2=Declare 2 string 1 for greet variable and another for name.
step3=take input from user its name.
step4=print the the greet variable and then his name variable.
step5=End

3.modify the previous program such that only the user Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.
step1=Start
step2=declare 2 string 1 for greet veriable and another for name.
step3=take the input from user name
step4=if string 2 is not equal to alic or bob then it go to step 3.
step5=print the greet and the alice and Bob name.
step6=End

4.write a program that ask the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n
step1=Start
step2=take a input number from user
step3=start a loop 1 to n.
step4=print the value of sum
step5=End

5.modify the privious program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum
step1=Start 
step2=take input number from user.
step3=start a loop from 1 to n.
step4=check the index which is divided by 3 or 5.
step5=afer every loop add i .
step6=print the i.
step7=End

6.write a program that prints a multipliction table for numbers up to 12.
step1=Start
step2=start a loop 1 to 12. 
step3=ineer lopp is start 1 to 10.
step4=multiply inner loop variable and outer loop variable.
step5=print the multiplication.
step6=when conditon is false inner loop go step 2 .
step7=End.

7.write a program that prints all prime numbers
step1=Start
Step2=take a number from user.
step3=start a outer loop 2 to n.
step4=decleare count=0.
step5=start inner loop 1 to outer level veriable.
step6=if the outer level veriable divide by inner level veriable its mode is equal to 0 then increase count
step7= the count is equal to two then it is prime 
step8=End

9.write a program that print the leep years
step1=Start
step2=take a two number from user for loer limit and upper limit.
step3=start a loop upto n
step4=check condition year%400is equal to zero or year%4==0 and year%100is not equal to zero.
step5=print yera.
step6=End.

8.write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secrate number after every guess the program tell the user whether their 
number was too large or too smallat the end the number of tries needed should be printed. it count only as try if they input the same 
number multiple times consecutively.
step1=Star
step2=declare variable i, guess no,count=0,and arr[100]
step3=start do while loop
step4=if the i is less than guess no then it is too small
step5=if the i is greater than guess no then it is too large
step6=if it is not is array count++
step7=print the count
step8=End
